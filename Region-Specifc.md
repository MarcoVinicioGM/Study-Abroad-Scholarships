| API-LAUREN LUND MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIP | This scholarship fund was created in memory of Lauren Elizabeth Lund of Bemidji, Minnesota. Lauren studied in Tuscania through the API program at Lorenzo de’Medici (LdM) in the fall of 2015. Lauren’s passion for learning, languages, wine, and coffee brought her to Tuscania. While there, she greatly enjoyed learning from the locals and the more relaxed lifestyle. In addition to her academics, Lauren’s favorite experience in Italy was being immersed in the culture through time spent with her host family, including weekly dinners with her host family grandmothers. Lauren was known for her love of life, friendship, and dedication to others. In establishing this scholarship, Lauren’s family would like to ensure that another student would be able to have an experience in Italy similar to Lauren’s. The Lauren Lund Memorial Scholarship will provide for full tuition for one student (participating in either the API Tuscania OR the API Two Italies in Florence and Tuscania program) each spring term. | <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdy9Izmaa8Vj3FvXafILHCToAjFPDrs2l914SMGO83frorF-g/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/u1KNU8z.png" width="118" alt="Apply"></a> |

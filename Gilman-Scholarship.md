# The Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship

This is the main scholarship that my roommate and I were able to acquire, and it was the almost sole reason we were able to study abroad in Singapore and Argentina, respectively. Combined we received over 7k in funding for our endeavors.

The core mission of the U.S. Department of State's Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship Program is to support students of limited financial means in studying or interning abroad. It is a competitive, merit-based scholarship for students who might otherwise lack the resources for international experiences. By funding these international experiences, the program aims to promote the nation's global standing. This context is important for applicants to recognize since their personal and professional goals can align with these national interests.

## Requirements

Eligibility criteria for the Gilman Scholarship:

* **U.S. Citizenship or Nationality:** Applicants must be citizens or nationals of the United States.
* **Undergraduate Status:** Applicants must be undergraduate students currently enrolled in a degree program.
* **Federal Pell Grant Recipient:** A cornerstone of the program's focus on students with limited financial means, applicants must be receiving a Federal Pell Grant at the time of application or provide proof that they will be receiving a Pell Grant during the term of their study abroad program or internship.

### Academic Standing and Institutional Accreditation

Applicants must be in good academic standing at an accredited institution of higher education within the United States. This includes students from both two-year and four-year institutions.

### Program Eligibility

The chosen study abroad or internship program must also meet specific criteria:

* **Credit-Bearing Program:** The program must be credit-bearing, meaning the student will earn academic credit for their participation. Proof of program acceptance is required before any scholarship funds are disbursed.
* **Program Length:** Programs can be up to one academic year in duration. Short-term programs are eligible, and there is no minimum program length requirement, provided all other eligibility criteria are met. (Note: Some university-specific guidance may mention a minimum duration, but official program guidelines state no minimum).
* **Location and Travel Advisories:** The study abroad or internship program must be located in a country or area with an overall Travel Advisory Level of 1 or 2, according to the U.S. Department of State's Travel Advisory System. Critically, even if a country has an overall Level 1 or 2 advisory, Gilman scholars are not permitted to travel to specific areas within that country if those areas are designated as Level 3 ("Reconsider travel to") or Level 4 ("Do not travel to"). Programs in countries or locations entirely designated as Level 3 or 4 are ineligible. The U.S. Department of State also reserves the right to request program changes if deemed necessary due to evolving health or security situations in a country or location.

### Specifics for Gilman-McCain Scholarship Applicants

A distinct component of the Gilman Program is the **Gilman-McCain Scholarship**. This scholarship is specifically designed to support the child and spousal dependents of active-duty U.S. military members. For these applicants, the financial aid requirement differs slightly: they must be recipients of any type of Title IV federal financial aid, rather than specifically the Pell Grant required for the standard Gilman Scholarship. Applicants must be a dependent child or spouse of active or activated U.S. military personnel at the time of their application.

## Financial Awards

* **Standard Scholarship Amounts:** Annually, nearly 3,000 scholarships are awarded, with individual amounts reaching up to $5,000. For context, the average award amount for recipients in the March 2025 application cycle at Western Kentucky University was $3,458.

### Additional Funding Opportunities:

* **Critical Need Language Award (CNLA):** Students who plan to study a critical need language while abroad may be eligible for up to an additional $3,000 in funding. This can bring the total possible award to $8,000 for students qualifying for both the standard Gilman and the CNLA. Critical Need Languages include but are not limited to, Arabic (all dialects), Chinese (all dialects), Bahasa Indonesia, Japanese, Turkic languages (Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Turkish, Turkmen, Uzbek), Persian languages (including Dari, Kurdish, Pashto, Tajiki), Indic languages (Hindi, Urdu, Nepali, Sinhala, Bengali, Punjabi, Marathi, Gujarati, Sindhi), Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Swahili, and Urdu. Hebrew is also listed, though programs in Israel are currently ineligible due to travel advisory levels.
* **STEM Supplemental Award:** An additional award of up to $1,000 is available for students who will be conducting STEM-related research as a formal, integrated part of their credit-bearing study abroad or international internship program. For this award, STEM fields are defined as agriculture, engineering, health professions, mathematics and computer science, and physical and life sciences.
* **Eligible Expenses:** The scholarship funds are intended to defray a range of eligible costs associated with studying or interning abroad. These include program tuition, room and board, books, local transportation, health insurance, international airfare, and fees for passports and visas.

## Beyond Funding (Non-Monetary Benefits)

The value of the Gilman Scholarship extends significantly beyond its financial contributions:

* **Noncompetitive Eligibility (NCE) for Federal Employment:** A highly valuable benefit, Gilman scholars become eligible for 12 months of noncompetitive eligibility (NCE) hiring status within the U.S. federal government upon completion of their program. This status may be extended under certain criteria. NCE allows federal agencies to hire eligible exchange program alumni outside of the formal competitive job announcement process and permits them to compete for certain federal employment jobs that are typically open only to current federal employees. This provision directly facilitates the entry of globally skilled individuals, cultivated by the Gilman experience, into federal service. It represents a tangible return on investment for the U.S. government, aligning with the program's goals of enhancing national security and economic prosperity by channeling talent into public service.
* **Skill Development:** Participation in the Gilman Program fosters the development of a wide range of valuable skills. These include proficiency in foreign languages and cross-cultural understanding, enhanced professional skills, improved language abilities, and a broader knowledge of the world. Impact studies show that 80% of Gilman alumni gained job-related skills, 95% experienced greater self-confidence, and 97% improved their multicultural communication skills as a result of their Gilman experience.
* **Networking Opportunities and Alumni Community:** Gilman scholars gain access to an extensive global network of over 44,000 fellow alumni. This network is accessible via a private online platform and offers significant opportunities for connection and mentorship. The Gilman Alumni Ambassador Program, comprised of accomplished past recipients, further provides mentorship, shares experiences at events, and offers application tips. This vast and active alumni community represents a lifelong resource, offering ongoing support, career advice, and a sense of shared experience that extends far beyond the study abroad period itself—a significant, often underestimated, long-term asset.
* **Professional Development:** Scholars have access to professional development seminars and various career-development resources designed to support their future endeavors.
* **Personal Growth:** The experience of living and learning in a vastly different environment often leads to profound personal growth. Scholars frequently report returning home with a deeper understanding of their place in the world and a heightened motivation to be active contributors to the international community. Testimonials from alumni consistently highlight the life-changing nature of their Gilman-funded experiences and the significant personal development they underwent.

### Overview of Required Essays

The Gilman application requires three main essays, with additional optional essays for those seeking supplemental awards:

* **Statement of Purpose Essay:** Maximum `7,000` characters, including spaces.
* **Community Impact Essays:**
    * **Building Mutual Understanding Essay:** Maximum `3,000` characters, including spaces.
    * **Follow-on Service Project Proposal:** Maximum `3,000` characters, including spaces.
* **Optional Essays (if applicable):**
    * **Critical Need Language Award (CNLA) Essay:** Maximum `2,000` characters, including spaces.
    * **STEM Supplemental Award Essay:** Maximum `2,000` characters, including spaces.

### Key Themes and Selection Criteria for Essays

The essay prompts are designed to elicit responses that demonstrate a candidate's suitability for the Gilman Scholarship by addressing several key themes and selection criteria:

* **Statement of Purpose:** This essay should clearly articulate the applicant's academic preparedness for study abroad, the anticipated impact of the experience on their educational and career trajectory, a strong rationale for their choice of program and destination, how the study abroad experience will help them achieve their future goals, and how they will draw upon their existing skills and experiences to navigate the challenges of a new environment.
* **Building Mutual Understanding:** Applicants need to explain how they will serve as a "citizen diplomat" while abroad. This involves detailing how they will represent the United States, share their background and experiences, actively engage with the host culture, and build meaningful relationships with local people. Demonstrating self-awareness of potential cultural biases is also beneficial.
* **Follow-on Service Project:** This proposal must outline a feasible project with clear goals and defined steps. It should identify a specific target audience and detail any planned collaborations with campus or community organizations. A crucial element is explaining how the project will directly contribute to increasing awareness of study abroad opportunities and the Gilman Scholarship itself. The project must be completed within six months of returning from abroad and cannot be a paid endeavor.

> Collectively, these prompts guide applicants to construct a coherent narrative that addresses "Why me?" (unique qualifications and contributions), "Why here?" (specific program and location choice), "Why now?" (timeliness in academic/career path), and "What next?" (future impact and give-back through the Follow-on Service Project).

### Tips for Compelling Content and Structure for Each Essay Type

* **General Advice:** It is highly recommended to compose essays in a word processing program first, rather than directly in the online application. Essays should be in paragraph format, not as numbered responses to individual prompt questions. Aim to "hook" the reader from the beginning with something that makes the applicant unique. Authenticity is key; applicants should tell THEIR story and be personal, as this is the committee's chance to get to know them. Specificity is also crucial; vague statements are less impactful than concrete examples and detailed plans.
* **Statement of Purpose:** Clearly connect the chosen program to specific academic, career, and personal goals. Go beyond superficial reasons for choosing a particular country or program; explain its unique relevance. If an applicant's GPA is below average, it is advisable to provide a brief explanation of the circumstances.
* **Building Mutual Understanding:** Move beyond general statements about open-mindedness. Provide specific examples of how the applicant plans to engage with the host culture and its people. It can be helpful to think of five adjectives that describe how one will positively represent the United States and then consider actions that demonstrate those qualities. Explicitly using the phrase "citizen diplomat" at least once is recommended.
* **Follow-on Service Project:** The proposal should be very detailed about the project plan, including concrete steps. Select a specific and realistic target audience, avoiding groups that are too broad or too narrow. Explain how the study abroad experience will be incorporated into the project's content or delivery. The Gilman Scholarship should be mentioned by name as part of the project's awareness goals. While standard ambassador roles are acceptable, unique projects that leverage an applicant's talents and experiences are often more competitive

## Post-Award: Receiving Funds and Pre-Departure Preparations

Once selected for a Gilman Scholarship, recipients will need to take further steps before funds are disbursed. Proof of acceptance into the proposed credit-bearing study abroad or internship program is required before the disbursement of the award. While specific procedural documents for receiving funds or detailed pre-departure checklists were not available in the reviewed materials, awarded students should anticipate needing to provide official program acceptance documentation and complete other administrative requirements. Close monitoring of all communications from the Gilman Program following an award notification is essential to ensure all necessary steps are completed promptly.

## Gilman Scholar Responsibilities & Terms (Beyond Follow-on Project)

Receiving a Gilman Scholarship is a formal agreement that comes with certain obligations. Scholars must:

* Use the award funds exclusively to defray eligible study or intern abroad costs as defined by the program (e.g., tuition, room and board, airfare).
* Understand that the Gilman Scholarship can only be received once. If a student has previously accepted and utilized a Gilman award, they are not eligible for another.
* Adhere to all terms and conditions of the scholarship, which will be provided upon notification of the award.
* complete their approved study abroad program.
* Complete and report on their Follow-on Service Project within six months of returning to the U.S.
